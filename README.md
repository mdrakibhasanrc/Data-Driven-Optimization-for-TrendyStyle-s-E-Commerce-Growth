### Project Title: Data-Driven Optimization for TrendyStyle's E-Commerce Growth

### Project Overview:
Company: TrendyStyle
Industry: E-commerce (Fashion & Apparel)

### Project Focus: Optimizing the website’s conversion rate by analyzing customer behavior, identifying key drop-off points, and implementing data-driven solutions to enhance the user experience.

### Tools and Technologies:

Google Analytics 4 (GA4): For tracking user behavior, events, and conversions across the website and app.

BigQuery: To manage, query, and analyze large datasets collected from GA4 and other sources.

Looker Studio: For creating visual reports and dashboards to monitor and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs).

Microsoft Clarity: To analyze user sessions, identify friction points, and optimize the website’s user interface (UI).

### Project Phases & Approach:

#### Phase 1: Data Collection & Setup:

Integrating BigQuery with GA4:

Configure GA4 to export data into BigQuery for deeper analysis. This allows you to query and analyze granular data, which is not always available directly in GA4.
Set up automated queries to pull in data such as product views, revenue, and user demographics.

#### Phase 2: Data Analysis & Insights:

Analyze GA4 data using BigQuery to identify key drop-off points in the user journey, such as high abandonment during checkout, and segment users by behavior, device, and location to find opportunities for optimization. Measure conversion rates at each funnel stage in BigQuery to pinpoint where users drop off and uncover potential barriers to conversion.
